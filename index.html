           <p>Dogs have beautiful looks that you would not want to<br> miss telling your friends about. </p>
           <p>We own a handbag dog. That at least is what my mother calls her, probably because she takes him shopping in her handbag. She is a miniature Yorkshire terrier and she is a delight. Her most attractive quality is that she is friendly to everyone, especially children. They love her molten-brown eyes and her glossy fur. She also has the cutest little paws. They are like a fox’s paws and she loves to dig up the garden with them. She also has a small, marshmallow tail. It is soft and white so we just call it the marshmallow.

She can be very ladylike and fussy about her food at times. She turns her nose up at dog food but would snap your hand off for a chocolate digestive. Her small, sharp teeth make short work of any treats we give her. She is always playful and that is why we adore her. Her whip-thin body is very energetic. I’m sure she believes she’s a gazelle or a cheetah at times! Although she can be as temperamental as a human child, we wouldn’t swop her for anything.</p>
